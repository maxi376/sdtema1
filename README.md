Hello. This is a .NET project that creates a web application and the role is understanding Request-Reply Communication.

The Client requirement are as follows:
Energy Management System that consists of a frontend and two microservices
designed to manage users and their associated smart energy metering devices. The system can be
accessed by two types of users after a login process: administrator (manager), and clients. The
administrator can perform CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations on user accounts
(defined by ID, name, role: admin/client), smart energy metering devices (defined by ID,
description, address, maximum hourly energy consumption), and on the mapping of users to
devices (each user can own one or more smart devices in different locations).
